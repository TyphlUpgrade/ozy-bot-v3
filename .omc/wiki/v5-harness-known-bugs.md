# v5 Harness Known Bugs

Bugs found during review that are deferred or represent latent risks. Tracked here for future phases.

## Open (Deferred)

### BUG-001: _processed set grows without bound
**Severity**: Low | **File**: `signals.py` | **Phase**: 2
`SignalReader._processed` accumulates every task filename forever. In a weeks-long run, this is unbounded memory growth. Also brittle: if a file is archived and re-created with the same name, it's silently skipped.
**Mitigation**: Remove entries from `_processed` after `archive()`, or switch to mtime-based high-water tracking.

### BUG-002: PipelineState.load drops state on version mismatch
**Severity**: Low | **File**: `pipeline.py` | **Phase**: 2
If a newer harness writes extra fields to `state.json`, an older harness catches `TypeError` and discards the entire state ("starting fresh"). A version downgrade silently loses the active task.
**Mitigation**: Pop unknown keys before `cls(**data)` construction. Keep `TypeError` catch only for genuine type mismatches.

### BUG-003: Frontmatter stripping is fragile
**Severity**: Low | **File**: `sessions.py` | **Phase**: 2
`split("---", 2)` works for well-formed YAML frontmatter but breaks if the closing `---` is missing (uses entire file including the `---` line as template). Body `---` markers (markdown horizontal rules) work only by coincidence of the maxsplit limit.
**Mitigation**: Use regex: `re.sub(r'\A---\n.*?\n---\n', '', template, count=1, flags=re.DOTALL)`.

### BUG-004: advance() accepts arbitrary stage strings
**Severity**: Low | **File**: `pipeline.py` | **Phase**: 2
No validation on `next_stage` parameter. A typo like `state.advance("reviwer")` puts the pipeline in a stage the match block silently ignores — task hangs forever with no error.
**Mitigation**: Define `VALID_STAGES` frozenset and validate in `advance()`, or use a `StrEnum`.

### BUG-005: write_signal filename not path-traversal-validated
**Severity**: Low | **File**: `signals.py` | **Phase**: 2
`_safe_task_id` guards all `SignalReader` methods, but `write_signal` accepts a raw `filename`. A caller passing `"../../evil.json"` could write outside the signal directory. Currently all callers are internal and safe.
**Mitigation**: Validate that `filename` contains no path separators.

### BUG-006: FIFO open race window
**Severity**: Low | **File**: `sessions.py` | **Phase**: 2
0.5s sleep between tmux launch and `os.open(O_WRONLY | O_NONBLOCK)` is a best-effort guess. If tmux is slow, `os.open` raises `OSError [ENXIO]` (no reader). No retry logic.
**Mitigation**: Retry `os.open` in a loop with exponential backoff (0.25s, 0.5s, 1s, 2s), catching ENXIO.

### BUG-007: restart() bypasses clawhip for teardown
**Severity**: Info | **File**: `sessions.py` | **Phase**: 2
`restart()` calls raw `tmux kill-session` but `launch()` uses `clawhip tmux new`. If clawhip tracks session state internally, bypassing it for teardown may leave stale metadata.
**Mitigation**: Use `clawhip tmux kill` if available.
